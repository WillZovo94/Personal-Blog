# Sunset-Lounge-Personal-Blog

[Personal Blog](https://willzovo94.github.io/Sunset-Lounge-Personal-Blog/)

## Description
- This project includes a functional personal blog. It provides a responsive design and functional javascript which helps you store user data into local storage and output that data onto the second page in a nice organized manner, creating blog posts.
- My motivation for working and creating this project was to figure out functionality by switching different HTML files to create multiple pages on a single project. As well as, using local storage to be able to store data and output it back on the page if desired. This was a big improvement to my understanding of how javascript works, and using functions to create new elements that were originally not on the HTML files by receiving that information from local storage. 

## Usage 
- You are given a responsive form to input data that will be used for your blog post.
